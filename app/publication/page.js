					Some people hold themselves accountable by logging work on
					productivity apps, while others turn to blogs and books inspirational
					productivity quotes. Regardless of how you motivate yourself to get
					things done in the workplace, now and then we all find ourselves
					searching for productivity tips to keep us moving forward. And if you
					don’t think this applies to you, consider this: research suggests that
					in an eight-hour workday, the average worker is only productive for
					two hours and 53 minutes. That leaves a lot of room for improvement.
				</p>
				<p className="trm-mb-40">
					Before you do anything else, take a few moments at the start of each
					day to organize & declutter your workspace. A clutter-free environment
					helps you think more clearly & produce better results, said Kristoph
					Matthews, head of engineering at NewtonX & founder of on-demand
					storage company Boxbee. By{" "}

					Color can have a major effect on your mood & productivity throughout
					the day, said Jenny Gauld, interior designer for office furniture &
					accessory retailer Turnstone. Blue can impart a calming feeling & help
					you focus, while red may be great for work requiring accuracy &
					attention to detail. Plants can also help people focus: A study by the{" "}
					<a

						className="link-effect"
					>
						American Society for Horticultural Science
					</a>{" "}
					found that workers who were exposed to plants in their workspace
					reported feeling less stressed & more productive.

				<p className="trm-mb-40">
					In addition to adding some color & plants to your workspace,
					decorating your desk or cubicle with a few personal knickknacks can
					help you feel more relaxed, which can boost your productivity. Gauld
					suggested adding meaningful career memorabilia, such as diplomas,
					awards, & other decorative items that help you feel appreciated & will
					motivate you.
				</p>
				<p className="trm-mb-40">
					Everyone has at least one task on the to-do list that keeps getting
					pushed back because the thought of doing it seems awful. That task is
					actually the one you should complete first, according to Matthews.
					Instead of waiting until the last minute to finish it, get it off your
					plate as soon as possible. Your other tasks will seem less daunting by
					comparison, & you&apos;ll stop stressing about that one task all day,
					making you more productive overall.
				</p>
				<p className="trm-mb-40">
					People vary in terms of when they are most productive. For example,
					are you a morning person or a night owl? It’s important to identify
					which hours of the day you feel most alert & attentive, & then
					dedicate those hours to your most important tasks. This is especially
					useful if you work remotely & can determine your schedule.
				</p>
				<p className="trm-mb-40">
					If you can&apos;t create a schedule around your most productive work
					time, consider organizing your priorities in your current schedule
					based on which hours of your workday you feel most alert. Your
					productivity peaks are often in 90 - 120-minute intervals.
				</p>
				<blockquote className="trm-color-quote trm-mb-40">
					Understand how your brain works & when you are most productive. For

					as long as I can.
				</blockquote>
				<p className="trm-mb-40">
					Whether it&apos;s taking a walk, going to your favorite coffee shop,
					reading a magazine or visiting with a colleague, taking short breaks
					that are unrelated to your work can make a huge difference in your
					performance. Your productivity diminishes the longer you go without a
					break. Kobel explained that this is why it’s recommended that people
					don’t work more than eight to 10 hours per day. At a certain point,
					she said, your body & mind simply cannot produce anymore.
				</p>
				<p className="trm-mb-40">
					Exercise isn&apos;t just good for your body; it can also positively
					impact your work performance. Physical exercise has been shown to
					affect mental health & focus, said Sam McIntire, founder of
					Deskbright, an online learning platform dedicated to helping
					entrepreneurs & employees. A great way to feel sharper & more
					productive? Try going for a run in the morning or starting your day
					with a workout, McIntire suggested. It doesn&apos;t hurt to sneak in
					some exercise on your breaks either.
				</p>
				<p className="trm-mb-40">
					It&apos;s not always easy to keep track of everything you need to do,
					so start each morning by writing down your goals for the day. When
					your focus is broken or you find yourself procrastinating, McIntire
					said, you can use the list to keep you on track, said McIntire. He
					suggested writing your list down on a Post-it or something that&apos;s
					visible from your desk, then returning to it when you need a reminder
					of what you should be working on.
				</p>
				<p className="trm-mb-40">
					Doing more than one thing at a time may seem like the best way to get
					all of your tasks done, but it can hurt your productivity more than it
					helps. Multitasking simply doesn’t work, & when you do it, you end up
					wasting time, Kobel said.
